        <p><a href="#" id="b1">Bees</a> are flying insects closely related to wasps and ants, known for their role in pollination and, in the case of the best-known bee species, the European honey bee, for producing <a href="#" id="b2">honey</a> and <a href="#" id="b3">beeswax</a>. Bees are a monophyletic lineage within the superfamily Apoidea and are presently considered a clade, called Anthophila. There are nearly 20,000 known species of bees in seven recognized biological families. They are found on every continent except Antarctica, in every habitat on the planet that contains insect-pollinated flowering plants.</p>

    <!-- <p><a href="#" id="bf1">Butterflies</a> are insects in the macrolepidopteran clade Rhopalocera from the order Lepidoptera, which also includes <a href="#" id="bf2">moths</a>. Adult butterflies have large, often brightly coloured wings, and conspicuous, fluttering flight. The group comprises the large superfamily Papilionoidea, which contains at least one former group, the skippers (formerly the superfamily "Hesperioidea") and the most recent analyses suggest it also contains the moth-butterflies (formerly the superfamily "Hedyloidea"). Butterfly fossils date to the Paleocene, which was about 56 million years ago.</p>
